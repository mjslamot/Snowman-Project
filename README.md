# Snowman-Project
These are bonus assignments in which I experimented with using random values to create images            
What this means is that every time these programs are run, the images will be altered slightly                                                              

Use the .html and .java to run a version of the project that was made in Java
I used random values to create the christmas tree, horizon and snowfall        
I'm trying to make it run directly from the browser.      

The third image was a bonus assignment for my CS135 course which was created using Racket                           
This project was inspired by the first, and makes use of random values to randomly create the horizon                    
Unfortunately, the source code cannot be published due to school regulations
