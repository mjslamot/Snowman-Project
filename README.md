# Snowman-Project
These are bonus assignments in which I experimented with using random values to create images            
What this means is that every time these programs are run, the images will be altered slightly                                                              

The animated images in the first two videos were created using Java            
I used random values to create the christmas tree, horizon and snowfall        
Unfortunately, the laptop on which the project was saved broke, so the source code is unavailable and the cellphone-taken videos are the only copies I have of the project.      

The third image was a bonus assignment for my CS135 course which was created using Racket                           
This project was inspired by the first, and makes use of random values to randomly create the horizon                    
Once more, the source code cannot be published due to school regulations
